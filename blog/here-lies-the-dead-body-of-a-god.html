				<p>on my desk. my laptop tells me that it is 1 am. i have a dead body of a god in front of me. i can hear a siren from my window - an ambulance passing by. i doubt that calling the emergency phone number will do any help.<br>it is not big. in fact, it is quite small. radiating heat. it is warm and slightly bright. i can almost see as small dust particles fly from it. it is decaying.<br>i don't know exactly how this small (seemingly benevolent) corpse of a god appeared on my desk. i went to the kitchen for a midnight snack (mostly crackers) and then returned to this. no note attached. but it certainly is a god, what else could it be?<br>it has the body of a human. it has hands and feet and a head. it has eyes and a nose. it has no hair. it is smiling and its eyes are closed. it seems to be sleeping, but i know that it is not. it is dead. i've touched it and felt no heartbeat (do gods have hearts? i've always thought them to be cruel). it is naked. i blush slightly. i've never expected to meet a god, let alone naked.</p><hr>
				<p>i think i was eight when i was first asked if i believed in god. it was a girl from my class.<br>"do you think there's god?" i remember her asking. i was small back then (i mean, we were all small), it was recess, we were having lunch.<br>"what's a 'god'?" i asked. i pretended not to know who (or what?) god was. i knew, of course. my mom was an atheist, but my dad was a muslim. my parents often fought and my mom grew to hate Islam. i didn't. well, at least i've unlearned that hatred now.<br>"um..." the girl thought for a moment. she was probably Christian (most of the kids were from Christian or atheist families in my school). "he is the guy who made humans."<br>"i thought it were monkeys who made humans." i was a devious child back then. i liked to tease other children, pretend that i was stupid. "did god also make monkeys?"<br>"i think he did everything."<br>"how?"<br>"i don't know."<br>"then how do you know he exists?"<br>"i just do."<br>i shrugged my shoulders.<br>"i don't."</p><hr>
				<p>it seems that i have been wrong. there is <i>a</i> god, if not <i>the</i> god. you know, the thing (guy?) reminds me of Buddha a bit. maybe buddhists are right after all. i wonder what i will reincarnate as?<br>i plop my mug on the table near the dead body of a god. i sigh. what do i do? i poke the guy a little. his skin is white, pale, slightly green. it smells mouldy. how long has he (it?) been dead for?<br>i'm afraid to touch him (or her, they don't really have any genitals). maybe i should try and put them in a box? figure out where they came from? for the first time in my life i actually ponder whether i should pray. how do i even do it? do you have to kneel and put your hands together? or maybe i should try and do it like those monks? through a trance?<br>it is a bit disappointing, quite frankly. not the corpse of a god on my table (although that too), but the realisation of it. have i been wrong my entire life? i mean, the guy surely is a god or an angel or something supernatural, i don't know. should i go to church now? are they even open?<br>it does make a bit sense that there are many gods out there. although, for all i know, maybe this is the only true god out there. maybe the world doesn't have a god anymore?<br>i turn on TV and flip through the news channels. nope, nothing much happening in the world (apart from starvation, genocide, earthquakes and floods, political scandals, and all the other stress-inducing things that i don't have the time to care about right now). i assume that if a god (the god?) was running the world, then maybe things would get out of control when they would die.<br>come to think of it, how did the little guy die? i look around their body for any signs of bruises or maybe stabs. gun shot wounds? do angels have guns?<br><br>it is 2 am right now. i am tired. i have an exam tomorrow (and i don't think saying 'sorry, there was a dead god on my table last night' will be a good excuse). i should go to bed.<br>i go to bed.</p><hr>
				<p>the next morning, the world is still there. i hear dogs barking. cars going by. have i slept in? i panic and stumble for my phone. no, i still have half an hour before my alarm clock. i look over at the desk. the dead body of a god has completely disappeared. was it a dream? or maybe the guy just decayed fully and now my room is full of dead god particles. god (ironic), i hope it's not the latter.<br>there is a note on the table. a sticky note, you know, the ones they sell in stationery stores? it reads:<br>"thank you for keeping them for a while. we had to organise their funeral. hope it wasn't a bother! don't worry, we'll repay you once the time comes (if the time comes, we are not sure about your biology and religious beliefs). with love, xoxo."<br>huh. so that's that. i go to the kitchen and put my kettle on.</p>

						<hr>
						<p><span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span>Carmen Gaudin was a French sex worker in the 19th century. The reason why she remains a relatively famous person till this day is because of Henri de Tolouse-Lautrec – a French painter and artist, who was at the time fascinated by Gaudin. Henri had painted a dozen of paintings featuring Carmen Gaudin, many of which are now on display in the <a href="https://www.nga.gov/" target="_blank">National Gallery of Art</a>.</p>
						<p><span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span>I have taken the surname of Carmen for no particular reason – I simply like her portraits and the way her surname sounds. In addition, it is a relatively uncommon surname, as far as I'm concerned.</p>

						<h3>What is Gallery?</h3>
						<hr>
						<p><span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span>Gallery is a part of my website dedicated to other people's art. Usually, it's some classical stuff which I find interesting or consider those paintings to be my favourites. All art in the Gallery section of the website is in Public Domain or re-uploaded with direct permission of the artist. Paintings which you might find in the gallery is like the one above! My most favourite ones are visible on home screen of the website, you can see them by closing this window (click the 'x' button above or <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="closeWindow()">here</a>).</p>
